The concept of a **bit**, which stands for *binary digit*, has been a
fundamental unit of information in the fields of information theory and
computing. Bitwise operations are used to manipulate and process data at the bit
level, and these operations are *crucial for efficient programming* in a variety
of domains, such as computer graphics and cryptography. JavaScript converts a
`Number` (a *64-bit floating* *point number*) to a *32-bit integer* when bitwise
operators (such as `|`) are applied. All bitwise operations are performed on
**32-bit integers**. This package includes [bit twiddling hacks] by *Sean Eron*
*Anderson* and many others.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. To use it on the web,
simply use the `extra_bit` global variable after loading with a `<script>`
tag from the [jsDelivr CDN].

```javascript
const xbit = require('extra-bit');
// import * as xbit from "extra-bit";
// import * as xbit from "https://unpkg.com/extra-bit/index.mjs"; (deno)

xbit.count(7);
// ‚Üí 3 (111 ‚áí 3)

xbit.parity(8, 2);
// ‚Üí 2 (10,00 ‚áí 10)

xbit.swap(6, 1, 0);
// ‚Üí 5 (110 ‚áí 101)

xbit.reverse(0xFFFF0000);
// ‚Üí 65535 (0x0000FFFF)

xbit.signExtend(15, 4);
// ‚Üí -1
